# Brief Definition
An optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters by moving in the direction of steepest descent of the loss function.

# Detailed Explanation
Gradient Descent is the fundamental optimization algorithm used to train machine learning models. It works by computing the gradient (partial derivatives) of a loss function with respect to model parameters and updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss.

The algorithm starts with initial parameter values and iteratively updates them using the formula: θ = θ - α∇J(θ), where θ represents parameters, α is the learning rate, and ∇J(θ) is the gradient of the loss function. The learning rate controls the step size and significantly affects convergence.

Variants include Batch Gradient Descent (uses entire dataset), Stochastic Gradient Descent (uses single examples), and Mini-batch Gradient Descent (uses small batches). Advanced optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, and AdaGrad build upon gradient descent with adaptive learning rates and momentum.
