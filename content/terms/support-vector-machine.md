# Brief Definition
A powerful supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal decision boundary by maximizing the margin between different classes.

# Detailed Explanation
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are based on the concept of finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes while maximizing the margin (distance) between the closest data points of different classes. These closest points are called support vectors, as they "support" or define the decision boundary.

SVMs can handle both linear and non-linear classification through the use of kernel functions, which map data into higher-dimensional spaces where linear separation becomes possible. Common kernels include polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels.

The algorithm is particularly effective for high-dimensional data and cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. SVMs are also memory efficient and versatile, working well for both classification and regression tasks (SVR - Support Vector Regression).
