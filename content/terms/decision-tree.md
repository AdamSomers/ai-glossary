# Brief Definition
A tree-like model that makes decisions by splitting data based on feature values, creating a hierarchical set of if-else conditions.

# Detailed Explanation
Decision Trees are intuitive machine learning models that mimic human decision-making processes. They work by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values that best separate the target classes or reduce prediction error. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf represents a final prediction.

The tree construction process involves selecting the best feature and split point at each node using criteria like Gini impurity, entropy, or mean squared error. The algorithm continues splitting until stopping criteria are met, such as maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, or insufficient improvement.

Decision trees are highly interpretable, making them valuable for understanding model decisions and explaining predictions to stakeholders. However, they can easily overfit and are sensitive to small changes in data, which is why ensemble methods like Random Forest are often preferred.
