# Brief Definition
A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data, revolutionizing natural language processing and beyond.

# Detailed Explanation
The Transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need," fundamentally changed how we approach sequence modeling. Unlike RNNs that process sequences step-by-step, Transformers can process all positions simultaneously using self-attention mechanisms.

The key innovation is the attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element. This enables better handling of long-range dependencies and parallel processing, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency and model performance.

Transformers consist of encoder and decoder stacks, each containing multi-head attention layers and feed-forward networks. The architecture has become the foundation for breakthrough models like BERT, GPT, and T5, driving advances in language understanding, generation, and translation.
