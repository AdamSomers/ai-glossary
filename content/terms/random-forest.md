# Brief Definition
An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees using bagging and random feature selection to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

# Detailed Explanation
Random Forest is one of the most popular and effective ensemble methods, building upon the decision tree algorithm. It creates a "forest" of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data (bootstrap sampling) and considers only a random subset of features at each split.

The algorithm combines predictions from all trees through voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression). This approach reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees while maintaining interpretability through feature importance scores. The randomness in both data sampling and feature selection helps create diverse trees that collectively make better predictions.

Random Forest is robust to outliers, handles missing values well, and provides built-in feature importance measures. It requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and often performs well out-of-the-box, making it a popular choice for many machine learning applications.
