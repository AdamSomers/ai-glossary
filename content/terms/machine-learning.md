# Brief Definition
A subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

# Detailed Explanation
Machine Learning is a revolutionary approach to problem-solving that allows computers to automatically improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Instead of programming explicit instructions for every possible scenario, ML systems learn patterns from data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data.

The core idea behind machine learning is to create algorithms that can identify patterns in data and use these patterns to make informed predictions or classifications. This approach has proven incredibly powerful across numerous domains, from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles.

Machine learning systems typically follow a process of training, validation, and deployment. During training, the algorithm analyzes large amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships. The validation phase tests the model's performance on new data to ensure it generalizes well. Finally, the trained model is deployed to make predictions on real-world data.
