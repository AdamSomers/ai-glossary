# Brief Definition
A supervised learning task that predicts discrete categories or classes for input data based on learned patterns from labeled training examples.

# Detailed Explanation
Classification is one of the most common supervised learning tasks, where the goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined categories or classes. The algorithm learns from labeled training data to identify patterns that distinguish between different classes, then applies this knowledge to classify new, unseen examples.

Classification problems can be binary (two classes) or multi-class (multiple classes). Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each algorithm has different strengths and is suitable for different types of data and problem characteristics.

Performance evaluation uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The choice of metric depends on the problem context, class distribution, and the relative importance of different types of errors.
