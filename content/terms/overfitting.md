# Brief Definition
A modeling error where a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, leading to poor performance on new data.

# Detailed Explanation
Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex relative to the amount and quality of training data available. The model memorizes specific examples rather than learning generalizable patterns, resulting in excellent performance on training data but poor performance on validation or test data.

This phenomenon is particularly common with complex models that have many parameters relative to the training data size. The model essentially "memorizes" the training set, including noise and outliers, rather than learning the underlying relationships that would generalize to new examples.

Overfitting represents one side of the bias-variance tradeoff, where the model has low bias but high variance. Detecting overfitting typically involves monitoring performance on separate validation data during training and observing when validation performance starts to degrade while training performance continues to improve.
