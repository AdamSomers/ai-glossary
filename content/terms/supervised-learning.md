# Brief Definition
A machine learning approach where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

# Detailed Explanation
Supervised learning is the most common paradigm in machine learning, where algorithms learn from input-output pairs to establish a mapping function. The "supervision" comes from providing the algorithm with the correct answers (labels) during training, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.

The process involves training a model on a dataset where both input features and desired outputs are known. The algorithm analyzes these examples to identify patterns and relationships, then uses this learned knowledge to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

Supervised learning problems fall into two main categories: classification (predicting discrete categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). The quality of supervised learning models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of labeled training data.
