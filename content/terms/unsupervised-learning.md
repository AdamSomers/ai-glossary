# Brief Definition
A machine learning approach that finds hidden patterns and structures in data without labeled examples or target outputs.

# Detailed Explanation
Unsupervised learning tackles the challenge of discovering hidden patterns in data when no target variable or correct answers are provided. Unlike supervised learning, the algorithm must identify structure, relationships, and patterns within the data itself, making it both more challenging and more exploratory in nature.

The primary goal is to understand the underlying structure of data, whether through grouping similar data points (clustering), reducing dimensionality while preserving important information, or discovering association rules. These techniques are particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.

Common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering (grouping similar items), dimensionality reduction (simplifying data while retaining key information), and anomaly detection (identifying unusual patterns). The lack of ground truth makes evaluation more subjective and domain-dependent.
