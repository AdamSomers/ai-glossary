# Brief Definition
A field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

# Detailed Explanation
Natural Language Processing (NLP) bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

NLP encompasses various tasks from basic text processing to complex language understanding. Modern NLP has been revolutionized by transformer architectures and large language models, enabling unprecedented capabilities in text generation, translation, and comprehension.

The field addresses challenges like ambiguity, context dependency, and the nuanced nature of human language. Recent advances in pre-trained language models have dramatically improved performance across NLP tasks.
