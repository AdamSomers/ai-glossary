# Brief Definition
Massive neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language across diverse tasks.

# Detailed Explanation
Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based neural networks with billions or trillions of parameters, trained on enormous datasets of text from the internet, books, and other sources. These models learn statistical patterns in language that enable them to perform a wide range of natural language tasks without task-specific training.

The breakthrough came with the transformer architecture and the "attention is all you need" paradigm, allowing models to process sequences in parallel and capture long-range dependencies. Models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT, and their successors have demonstrated emergent capabilities in reasoning, coding, creative writing, and complex problem-solving.

LLMs exhibit few-shot and zero-shot learning abilities, meaning they can adapt to new tasks with minimal or no additional training examples. This versatility has made them foundational tools for chatbots, content generation, code assistance, research, and numerous other applications, fundamentally changing how humans interact with AI systems.
