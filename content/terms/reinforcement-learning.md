# Brief Definition
A machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, guided by rewards and penalties.

# Detailed Explanation
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is inspired by behavioral psychology and focuses on how agents should take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't require labeled data; instead, agents learn through experience by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

The RL framework consists of an agent, environment, states, actions, and rewards. The agent observes the current state, takes an action, receives a reward, and transitions to a new state. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes expected cumulative reward over time.

RL has achieved remarkable successes in game playing (Chess, Go, video games), robotics, autonomous systems, and resource allocation. The combination of RL with deep learning (Deep RL) has enabled breakthroughs in complex domains previously thought intractable.
