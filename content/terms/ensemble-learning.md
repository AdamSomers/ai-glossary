# Brief Definition
A machine learning technique that combines multiple models to create a stronger predictor than any individual model alone.

# Detailed Explanation
Ensemble Learning leverages the principle that combining multiple weak learners can create a strong learner with better performance and generalization than individual models. The key insight is that different models make different types of errors, and by combining them strategically, we can reduce overall error.

Common ensemble methods include bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) which trains models on different subsets of data, boosting which sequentially trains models to correct previous errors, and voting/averaging which combines predictions from multiple models. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are popular implementations of these concepts.

Ensemble methods often achieve state-of-the-art performance in machine learning competitions and real-world applications. They provide robustness against overfitting, improved generalization, and can handle different types of data effectively.
