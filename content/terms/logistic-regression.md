# Brief Definition
A statistical method for binary and multiclass classification that uses the logistic function to model the probability of class membership.

# Detailed Explanation
Logistic regression is a linear classifier that uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to transform linear combinations of input features into probabilities. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

The model uses the sigmoid function σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z)) where z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ. This function maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, making it perfect for probability estimation. The decision boundary is typically set at 0.5 probability.

The algorithm uses maximum likelihood estimation to find optimal coefficients, often solved through iterative methods like gradient descent. Logistic regression provides interpretable results through odds ratios and is naturally probabilistic, making it valuable for risk assessment and decision-making applications.
