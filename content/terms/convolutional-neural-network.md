# Brief Definition
A specialized deep learning architecture designed for processing grid-like data such as images, using convolution operations to detect local features.

# Detailed Explanation
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed to process data with a grid-like topology, most commonly images. They use mathematical convolution operations instead of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers, making them highly effective for computer vision tasks.

CNNs leverage three key ideas: local connectivity, parameter sharing, and translation invariance. Convolutional layers apply filters across the input to detect features like edges, textures, and patterns. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important information. The hierarchical structure allows CNNs to learn increasingly complex features from simple edges to complete objects.

The architecture typically consists of alternating convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for final classification. This design dramatically reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected networks while maintaining high performance on visual tasks.
