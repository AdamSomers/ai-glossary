# Brief Definition
The study of moral principles and guidelines for developing, deploying, and using artificial intelligence systems responsibly.

# Detailed Explanation
Ethics in AI addresses the moral implications and societal impact of artificial intelligence technologies. As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, questions of fairness, accountability, transparency, and human welfare become increasingly critical.

Key ethical concerns include algorithmic bias and discrimination, privacy and surveillance, job displacement and economic impact, autonomous decision-making in critical areas like healthcare and criminal justice, and the concentration of AI power in few organizations. The field also grapples with questions of AI consciousness, rights, and the long-term implications of artificial general intelligence.

Ethical AI development involves principles like fairness (ensuring equitable treatment across groups), accountability (clear responsibility for AI decisions), transparency (explainable and interpretable systems), and beneficence (maximizing benefits while minimizing harm). Organizations and governments are developing frameworks, regulations, and best practices to guide responsible AI development and deployment.
