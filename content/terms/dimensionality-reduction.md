# Brief Definition
The process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information and patterns.

# Detailed Explanation
Dimensionality reduction addresses the "curse of dimensionality" by transforming high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional representations. This technique is crucial when dealing with datasets that have many features, which can lead to computational inefficiency, overfitting, and difficulty in visualization.

There are two main approaches: feature selection (choosing a subset of original features) and feature extraction (creating new features that are combinations of original ones). Popular methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which finds directions of maximum variance, and t-SNE, which preserves local neighborhood structures for visualization.

The benefits include reduced computational cost, improved model performance by removing noise and redundancy, better visualization capabilities, and mitigation of the curse of dimensionality. However, dimensionality reduction may result in some information loss and can make the data less interpretable.
