# Brief Definition
The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

# Detailed Explanation
Artificial Intelligence represents one of the most transformative technologies of our time, encompassing the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and problem-solving.

AI systems can be categorized into narrow AI (designed for specific tasks) and general AI (hypothetical systems with human-level intelligence across all domains). Current AI applications are primarily narrow AI, excelling in specific domains like game playing, image recognition, or natural language processing.

The field combines computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy to create intelligent agents. Modern AI relies heavily on machine learning techniques, where systems improve their performance through experience rather than explicit programming.
