# Brief Definition
A supervised learning task that predicts continuous numerical values based on input features, establishing relationships between variables.

# Detailed Explanation
Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model and predict continuous target variables. Unlike classification which predicts discrete categories, regression predicts numerical values along a continuous scale.

The most basic form is linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable. More complex variants include polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and non-linear methods like decision tree regression and neural network regression.

Regression models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. The choice of algorithm depends on the data characteristics, relationship complexity, and interpretability requirements.
