# Brief Definition
Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that learn to perform tasks by analyzing examples, without being programmed with task-specific rules.

# Detailed Explanation
Neural networks are a fundamental concept in machine learning and artificial intelligence, designed to mimic the way biological neurons process information in the human brain. These computational models consist of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) organized in layers that can learn complex patterns from data.

A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that determines the strength of the signal passed between them. During training, these weights are adjusted through a process called backpropagation, which minimizes the difference between the network's predictions and the actual target values.

The power of neural networks lies in their ability to learn non-linear relationships and complex patterns that traditional algorithms might miss. They excel at tasks involving pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, making them particularly effective for problems like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

Modern neural networks can have millions or even billions of parameters, allowing them to model incredibly complex relationships in data. However, this complexity also means they require large amounts of training data and computational resources to achieve optimal performance.
