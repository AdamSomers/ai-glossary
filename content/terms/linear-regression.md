# Brief Definition
A fundamental supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables using a linear equation.

# Detailed Explanation
Linear regression is one of the most basic and widely used statistical methods for predictive modeling. It assumes a linear relationship between input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable). The goal is to find the best-fitting line through the data points that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

The model is expressed as y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε, where β values are coefficients to be learned, x values are features, and ε represents error. Simple linear regression involves one feature, while multiple linear regression handles multiple features.

The algorithm uses ordinary least squares (OLS) to find optimal coefficients by minimizing the mean squared error. Linear regression provides interpretable results, showing how each feature contributes to the prediction, making it valuable for both prediction and understanding relationships in data.
