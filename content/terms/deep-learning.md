# Brief Definition
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data, enabling computers to solve complex problems like image recognition and natural language understanding.

# Detailed Explanation
Deep learning represents a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence, utilizing neural networks with many layers (typically more than three) to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that require manual feature engineering, deep learning systems can automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification from raw data.

The "deep" in deep learning refers to the number of layers in the neural network. Each layer learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. For example, in image recognition, early layers might detect edges and textures, middle layers might recognize shapes and patterns, and deeper layers might identify specific objects or concepts.

This hierarchical learning approach has revolutionized many fields of AI. Deep learning models have achieved human-level or superhuman performance in tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, machine translation, and game playing. The success of deep learning has been driven by three key factors: the availability of large datasets, increased computational power (especially GPUs), and algorithmic innovations.

Deep learning architectures include feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and transformers for natural language processing. Each architecture is designed to handle specific types of data and problems effectively.
