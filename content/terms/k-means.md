# Brief Definition
A popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters by grouping similar data points around centroids.

# Detailed Explanation
K-Means clustering is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms that aims to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The algorithm works iteratively to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).

The process begins by randomly initializing k centroids, then alternates between two steps: assignment (assigning each point to the nearest centroid) and update (recalculating centroids based on assigned points). This continues until convergence, when centroids no longer move significantly.

K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and of similar size, making it effective for well-separated, compact clusters. However, it struggles with clusters of different shapes, sizes, or densities. The choice of k (number of clusters) is crucial and often determined using methods like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
