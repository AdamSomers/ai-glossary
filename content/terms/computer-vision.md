# Brief Definition
A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, including images and videos.

# Detailed Explanation
Computer Vision aims to replicate human visual perception through computational methods. It involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images to extract meaningful information and make decisions based on visual data.

The field has been transformed by deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data. Modern computer vision systems can perform complex tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and scene understanding with human-level or superhuman accuracy.

Applications span from medical imaging and autonomous vehicles to augmented reality and industrial automation. The integration of computer vision with other AI technologies continues to drive innovation across industries.
