# Brief Definition
A statistical method for evaluating machine learning models by partitioning data into subsets, training on some subsets, and validating on others to assess generalization performance.

# Detailed Explanation
Cross-validation is a crucial technique for assessing how well a machine learning model will generalize to independent datasets. It addresses the problem of limited data by systematically using different portions of the dataset for training and validation, providing a more robust estimate of model performance than a single train-test split.

The most common form is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained k times, each time using k-1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation. The final performance estimate is the average across all k iterations.

Cross-validation helps in model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and detecting overfitting. It provides confidence intervals for performance estimates and helps ensure that results are not dependent on a particular train-test split.
