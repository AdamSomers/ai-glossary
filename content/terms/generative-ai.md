# Brief Definition
AI systems that can create new content, including text, images, audio, and code, by learning patterns from training data.

# Detailed Explanation
Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, focusing on creating new content rather than just analyzing or classifying existing data. These systems learn the underlying patterns and distributions in training data to generate novel outputs that resemble the original data.

Key technologies include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which pit two neural networks against each other; Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which learn compressed representations; diffusion models, which gradually refine noise into coherent outputs; and transformer-based models like GPT for text generation.

The field has exploded with applications ranging from ChatGPT for conversational AI to DALL-E for image generation, Copilot for code assistance, and various tools for music, video, and 3D content creation. These systems are transforming creative industries, software development, content creation, and human-computer interaction.
