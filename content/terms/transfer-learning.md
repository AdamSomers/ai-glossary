# Brief Definition
A machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from pre-trained models to solve related tasks more efficiently.

# Detailed Explanation
Transfer learning is a powerful approach that takes advantage of features learned by models trained on large datasets and applies them to new, related tasks. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning starts with a pre-trained model and adapts it to the specific problem at hand.

This technique is particularly valuable in deep learning, where training large neural networks requires substantial computational resources and data. Common approaches include feature extraction (using pre-trained layers as fixed feature extractors) and fine-tuning (updating pre-trained weights for the new task).

Transfer learning is especially effective when the source and target domains are related, such as using a model trained on general images for medical image analysis, or adapting a language model trained on general text for domain-specific tasks. It significantly reduces training time, data requirements, and computational costs while often achieving better performance than training from scratch.
