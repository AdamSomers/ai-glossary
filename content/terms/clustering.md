# Brief Definition
An unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together into clusters based on their characteristics and relationships.

# Detailed Explanation
Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task that aims to discover hidden patterns in data by grouping similar observations together. Unlike classification, clustering doesn't require labeled data; instead, it identifies natural groupings based on similarity measures and distance metrics.

Common clustering algorithms include K-means (partitioning data into k clusters), hierarchical clustering (creating tree-like cluster structures), and density-based methods like DBSCAN (finding clusters of varying shapes and sizes). Each algorithm has different assumptions about cluster shape, size, and density.

The choice of clustering algorithm depends on the data characteristics, desired cluster properties, and domain requirements. Evaluation of clustering results often involves measures like silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares, and domain-specific validation.
