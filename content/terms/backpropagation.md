# Brief Definition
The fundamental algorithm for training neural networks that efficiently computes gradients by propagating errors backward through the network layers.

# Detailed Explanation
Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm that enables neural networks to learn by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. It works by applying the chain rule of calculus to efficiently calculate how much each weight contributes to the overall error.

The algorithm operates in two phases: forward pass and backward pass. During the forward pass, input data flows through the network to produce predictions. During the backward pass, the error is propagated backward from the output layer to the input layer, computing gradients for each weight along the way.

The key insight is that gradients can be computed efficiently by reusing intermediate calculations, avoiding the need to compute derivatives from scratch for each weight. This makes training deep networks computationally feasible and is the foundation of modern deep learning.
